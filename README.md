This repository contains material (slides and code) for the Predictive Analytics module on parallel programming and HPC. 

There are three parts to the material: 
1. Parallel programming on CPU: in directory `pp`; 
2. Parallel programming on GPU: in directory `cuda-pp`; 
3. High performance computing related: in directory `hpc`. 

Before coming to the class, make sure you:
1. download the code
2. create a Google Colab account, if you already have a Google account, then it should just link to it. 
3. put the `cuda-pp` code in your Google drive, and the `.ipynb` file within `cuda-pp` in your Colab folder
4. for Windows users, install a unix shell, so you can log into the HPC. 
5. the login to the HPC is your SCEM/CDMS account, so make sure you know what it is. If you've forgotten, then log a call to IT.
